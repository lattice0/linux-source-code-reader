# Fuchsia Source Code Reader

Little container that helps in reading/studying the fuchsia source code. Not designed for building right know.

It has a docker container but the intent is for you to open in VSCode with the `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` plugin. 

Simply open this project on VSCode having the plugin + docker and you'll land on an environment for reading the source code.
